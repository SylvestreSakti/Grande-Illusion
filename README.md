# Grande-Illusion
by Gael Colas and Sylvestre Prabakaran, 2nd year students from the French engineering school CentraleSupélec.

 Goal : Realization of robotic feet to perform the "Swing a lady in half illusion.
 A live performance of our system can be seen here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2_MQekyIXk
 
 This is a "projet innovation" project we led in our 2nd year in CentraleSupélec (2016). 
 Our supervisors were Hanane Meliani and Laurent Cabaret from the LISA Lab.
 
 This project involved :
  - Arduino : we used an Arduino board to control the robotic feet ;
  - Motion capture : we used a motion capture software to ;
  - PCB : we printed a circuit board to compactely gather our electronic components ;
  - 3D-modeling and printing : we modeled and printed a plastic enveloppe to hide our electronic board.

This repository gathers all our code and the files we used in our project. Our final report and presentation is at the root (written in French).
